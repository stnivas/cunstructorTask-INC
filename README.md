1. Write a class with a default constructor & print “Default Constructor Called” inside the constructor.
Invoke this constructor from a separate runner class & print your object & the String above.
2. Write a class with an additional constructor which accepts “String” &  print the String inside the
Constructor. Invoke this constructor from a separate runner class & print your object & the String
above.
3. Write a class with an additional constructor which accepts Integer &  print the Integer inside the
Constructor. Invoke this constructor from a separate runner class & print your object & the integer
above.
4. Write a class with an additional constructor which accepts ArrayList &  print the ArrayList inside
the Constructor. Invoke this constructor from a separate runner class & print your object & the
ArrayList above.
5. Write a class with an additional constructor which accepts custom object &  print the custom
object inside the Constructor.Invoke this constructor from a separate runner class & print your
object & the custom object above.
6. Write a class with a String variable, integer variable, ArrayList variable, custom object variable.
Have the necessary getter & setter methods for these variables. Now define a constructor which
accepts all these variables as an argument & sets the incoming value to the appropriate
variables. Now from a separate runner class, you should try to create an instance for your class
using the above said constructor & print your object. (toString() can be overridden in your class)
7. Now from a separate runner class, you should try to create an instance for the above class using
the default constructor. Using that call the appropriate setter methods to set the values for the
String, integer, ArrayList & custom object variables. After that invoke the appropriate getter
methods to print each value that is set previously
8. Write a class with a default constructor but make it private.  Then print “private default
Constructor called” inside the constructor. Now from a separate runner class, you should try to
create an instance for your class & print your object.
9. Write a class & create a static default constructor & print “static default constructor called”.
Compile this class & observe what happens. List down your understanding.
10. Write an abstract class with a default constructor & an abstract method. Print “Default
Constructor called” inside the constructor. Compile that abstract class. Now try to invoke this
constructor from a separate runner class & compile the runner class. Observe what happens. List
down your understanding. Then analyze the need for a constructor in abstract class
